# admin-scripts
Short and simple scripts for system administration

These scripts are mostly for practice and for general light use.

The most important scripts:

- **ghost-backup.sh** : Makes a back-up of my blog and uploads it to an AWS bucket.
- **doku-issues.rb**  : Aggregates issues in my wiki and puts a list of them into the issues.txt file.
- **sysinfo.py**      : Picks up system information from a CentOS machine -- used for documentation. Requires packages.txt
